# Inventory optimization

Finally, you got it! You found the Infinite Treasure of the Leprechaun-Dragon!

Now, you have to decide what to loot. Your inventory is a 5x4 rectangle (5 tiles width, 4 tiles height).

Each item of the treasure also fits in a rectangle and has a value:

    - Potion of Potionentiality, 1x1, 30 gold,
    - Jeweled Dog Draught Excluder, 3x1, 150 gold,
    - Spartan Shield, 2x2, 300 gold,
    - Palindromic Sword o’Drows, 1x3, 120 gold,
    - Unobsidian Armor, 2x3, 540 gold,
    - Wardrobe of Infinite Lions, 20x10, 1337 gold.

You can not turn the items. For example, the Unobsidian Armor is 2 tiles in width and 3 in height. It can not be 3 tiles in width and 2 in height.

Since it’s an Infinite Treasure, there are as many items of each type as you want.

Which items do you take, and how do you organize them in your inventory to have the most significant value in gold?

Try to code a generic solution that works with other inventory sizes and item types with specified dimensions and values.

Happy Looting!
